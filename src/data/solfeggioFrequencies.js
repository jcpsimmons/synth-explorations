// 432 Hz

// Many ancient musical instruments were constructed for 432 Hz tuning and before the mid-20th century, 432 Hz was the standard of instrumental tuning. Since then 440 Hz tuning has become the norm. The 432 Hz frequency resonates with the Schumann Resonance of 8 Hz and is known for its deeply calming and soothing effects.

// A recent double-blind study from Italy showed that music tuned to 432 Hz slows down the heart rate when compared to 440 Hz. This frequency fills the mind with feelings of peace and well-being, making it the perfect accompaniment for yoga, gentle exercise, meditation, or sleep.

// 528 Hz

// Even though the science on the reparative effects of the 528 Hz is still in its infancy, early research indicates that it has the ability to heal and repair the body.

// A 2018 study from Japan discovered that music tuned to the frequency of 528 Hz significantly reduced stress in the endocrine systems and autonomic nervous systems—even after a mere five minutes of listening. And in a study published in the Journal of Addiction Research & Therapy, the frequency of 528 Hz reduced the toxic effects of ethanol, the principle ingredient found in alcoholic drinks, on cells. Even more astounding was that this frequency also increased cell life by about 20 percent.
